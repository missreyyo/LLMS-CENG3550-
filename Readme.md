# <font color="BLACK">Large Language Model Safer  </font>

## Introduction
This project explores critical challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is a blockchain-based application developed using Solidity, with a focus on decentralized storage and user interaction. 


### Problems
1. Extensive Data Usage in LLMs
2. High Operational Costs
3. Data Security Issues
4. Vulnerability to Malicious Inputs

### Solution

### Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle**: Used for compiling and migrating smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: Provides a local blockchain for testing.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS**: Integrated for decentralized file storage, with a local node for enhanced speed.
- **React**: For developing the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For developing the user interface.

## How to Run Our Project On Your Computer

## Instructions

### 1. Cloning the Code
First, clone our codes onto your computer.

Note: Ensure you have Node.js, Truffle, and Ganache installed.

### 2. Opening the Code
Open the cloned codes in a code editor, preferably Visual Studio Code.

### 3. Launching Ganache
Start Ganache to create a personal blockchain for development purposes.

### 4. Configuring Metamask
Open Metamask and add the Ganache network to your Metamask account.

### 5. Adding New Account to Metamask
Add a new account to your Metamask wallet using a private key obtained from Ganache.

### 6. Starting the Local IPFS Node
Open Command Prompt (CMD) and run the following command to start the local IPFS node:
```
ipfs daemon
```

### 7. Migrating Contracts with Truffle
Open a new terminal in your code editor and execute:
```
truffle migrate --reset
```
Note: This command provides you with a contract address. Replace the existing contract address in the `ethereum.js` file with this new one.

### 8. Running the Application
Navigate to the client directory and start the application:
```
cd client
npm start
```

### 9. Successful Launch
After following these steps, your program should be up and running. Enjoy!

## Good Days!
